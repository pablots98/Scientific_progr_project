# Scientific_progr_project
Repository for Scientific programming project
In this repository there are 4 folders, each one containing the fundamental files to be able to run the main scripts, which are one for each method studied in the project.
Make sure to extract all files and save them in the same folder to avoid errors.

The main objective is to evaluate different threholding methods that are used in the field of modeling metabolism. To do this, all of them will be executed in order to select those that are considered core genes, and then evaluate their performance based on the number of housekeeping genes (genes important for the functioning of the cell) that are considered core genes. This will return a percentage, which is expected to show us which algorithm works best, to implement it in future research.

On the other hand, and as a complementary investigation, the possibility of changing the form of data normalization was considered, from the established FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) to TPM (Transcripts Per Million) which seems to be a better measure, allowing a better comparison between different samples.
